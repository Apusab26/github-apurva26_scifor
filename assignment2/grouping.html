    <h1>A.P.J.Abdul kalam</h1>
    <h2>Writing:</h2>
    <p>In his book India 2020,kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop india into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by 2020. He regarded his work on india's nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert india's place as a future superpower.
    <br>
        I have idientified five areas where india has a core competence for integrated action:
        <br>
        1. Agriculture and food processing;
        <br>
        2. Education and healthcare;
        <br>
        3. information and communication technology;
        <br>
        4. Infrastructure,reliable and quality electric power,surface transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country;
        <br>
        5. Self-reliance in critical technologies.
